                        <p>My best clients are SaaS companies with over $1M ARR that are looking for a way to build a <b>defensible competitive moat</b> around their brand.</p>
                        <p>I firmly believe the combination of SEO and content marketing is the only way to do it. It’s simple: your competitors can outbid you on your ads with a few clicks, but it can take years to dethrone a brand in organic search with a well-executed SEO strategy.</p>
